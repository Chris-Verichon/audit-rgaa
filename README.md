# audit-rgaa
Web accessibility audit tool based on the French RGAA (Référentiel Général d'Amélioration de l'Accessibilité)

## Git workflow
- Merge feature branches into `dev` first.
- Keep `master` for stable/release-ready merges only.
- If a feature is merged to `master` by mistake, open a PR from that commit branch into `dev` so `dev` receives the latest feature changes.
